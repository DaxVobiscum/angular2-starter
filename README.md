# Angular2 Starter

Getting started with Angular2. Contains small tutorial apps from the [offical Angular QuickStart guide](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart).

Currently contains two apps, `my-app` and `angular-tour-of-heroes`. With [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) installed (`npm install angular-cli --global`), simply `cd` into one of the app directories and start the app using `ng serve --open`.
